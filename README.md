# 👋 Hello fren! my name is Omid Alekaisr!

🌟 Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I'm an M.Sc. control engineer at K.N. Toosi University of Technology with a strong background in artificial intelligence and image processing techniques. My thesis focused on developing a novel data-driven control (DDC) method.

🌱 I primarily work with image processing tools, but I'm really enthusiastic about learning more about crypto and blockchain.
